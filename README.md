samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.


## Merge Conflict Resolution

During merging `develop` branch into `master`, a conflict occurred in `icons_manger.dart`. 

I resolved it by combining the UI enhancement from `develop` (icon_manger.dart)  refactor from `master`. 

This ensured that both features coexist without UI issues.
